# Migrating from v7 to v8

This guide provides instructions for migrating to version `v8.0.0` of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:

- [Migrating from v7 to v8](#migrating-from-v7-to-v8)
  - [Chains](#chains)
  - [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
  - [Relayers](#relayers)
  - [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.
